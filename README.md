## About
- This is where I am finally transcribing all of my write-ups for the various challenges in which I've participated in the last few years.
- If the directory shows "1.md" it is a placeholder with no information yet. I create my write-ups on my computer and upload them to GH when they're finished.
- Once it is current I will update the description.
- Not all write-ups will have pretty text, I haven't gotten to that yet.
- I'm terrible at keeping up with documentation.
