## 2021 NSA Codebreaker Challenge Write-Up

### Task 0
```bash
- Enter the discord server and follow the prompts on the welcome screen
- Go to the bot-commands channel and enter !task0
- Enter the bot response into the challenge
```

### Task 1
```bash
- Download the .pcap and the text file
- Use the ip.addr== filter to check all subnets in the text file
- For the four subnets that produce a response, save the following:

  1. Subnet
  2. Timestamps – try to note the ones with HTTP/1.0 200 responses in the .pcap
  3. Source IP
  4. Destination IP (will be the same for all 4, this is the LP)

- Enter the 4 source IP addresses into the challenge
```
###	Task 2
```bash
- Task 2 gives you a subnet, compare it to the list of subnets you saved from T1.
- Note the timestamp of that subnet – this is the time zone for the company.
- Now open proxy.log and look at the time zone at the top of the document.
- Calculate the time difference for the HTTP/1.0 200 response connected to the company subnet’s IP address.
- Go to the logins.json file, CTRL+F and enter the newly calculated timestamp. There should only be one occurrence found.
- Note the LOGONID from that single occurrence. This will be in integer format, and you can provide it in base 10 or base 16.
- Enter the Logon ID into the challenge.
```
### Task 3
```bash
- First, remember that single HTTP/1.0 200 request we found in the .pcap? Right click it and export as raw data – this should not have a file extension, but it should be done on Windows.
- Now, use Notepad, Mousepad, or an email viewer to see the background contents of each email file for a cipher.
- Save the Message ID of the email that you suspect – include the <arrows> in the result.
- This cipher is done the same way twice, so once you decode it, copy the answer, and decode it the same way a second time.
- Once you have decoded the cipher, you will have a PowerShell script, save it to a text file.
- Open PowerShell and cd:/ to the location of the raw data you exported in step 1.
- Enter the PowerShell script in one line at a time
- After the $result line is entered, type echo $result and copy the resulting code to a text file
- Look at the last line of the $result. Enter it into the challenge along with the <Message ID>
```
### Task 4
```bash
- To view the .DAT file, install Windows Registry Recovery. For the artifacts, you can use Autopsy Digital Forensics
- First, open the output of the $result from Task 3 and review it to get an idea of what the malware is doing.
- Open the .DAT file in WRR and view as raw data to navigate via a file system
- You’ll find a path to login sessions. Pay attention to the Hostnames.
```

### Task 5 Part 3
```bash
- I’m so pissed off. It’s /USR/BIN/MALICIOUSFILEGOESHERE.
- Happy file hunting ya filthy animals
```
I did not complete tasks 6-10 due to finals.
