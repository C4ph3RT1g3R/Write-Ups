# Basic Server Maintenance and Cleaning [NG]
Author: Steven Rodriguez
Framework Category: Operate and Maintain
Specialty Area: Systems Administration
Work Role: System Administrator
Task Description: Conduct periodic system maintenance including cleaning (both physically and electronically), disk checks, routine reboots, data dumps, and testing. (T0435)

## Scenario
Several of our employees have been complaining about computers not functioning properly and in turn causing a negative effect on work productivity. I've come to the conclusion that DASwebs is in need of a regular maintenance plan. This plan needs to cover basic maintenance that will be ran often as well as more thorough maintenance that will be done less frequently. You will create a detailed guide as to what types of maintenance will be done and maintenance scheduling. If accepted, your guide will be what we have interns using to conduct said maintenance.

## Additional Information
More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge. Hybrid challenges do not have checks, their only deliverable being usually a report or plan. This should be done within the documentation tab of the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...
